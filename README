0 Preface
--------------------
So, we all run annual NCAA March Madness basketball pools among friends and 
family. We have found that the management services provided by ESPN, Yahoo, CBS, 
etc., give limited controls to the league administrator, and we were not satisfied 
with any existing solutions on the web.  This led to the development of 
March Madness Bracket Competition.

March Madness Bracket Competition will allow you and your friends to run a large
NCAA tournament pool without having to manually score and collect a bunch of 
brackets.

03/12/2010 v 1.5.3.1

- updated all URLs in project to point to the new sourceforge project location
- updated project name in all files to reflect the new name

  an 'about' page or something for this)
- made smacktalk header only appear on front page if there is any smacktalk
- made it so a bracket added when a tourney entry cost is zero is automatically 
  set to 'exempt' instead of 'unpaid'

03/27/2009 v1.5.1

If you have an existing install,
THIS VERSION REQUIRES YOU TO UPDATE YOUR DATABASE STRUCTURE.
Run the convert_1_5_to_1_5_1_structure.sql script.

- Add the ability to post smack talk on brackets.
- Add a feed to the front page to see all the smack talk.
- Add icons to denote when a bracket has new smack talk.
- Calculate the probability of a bracket winning given a list of end game scenarios.
  Probabilities are based on historical performance of the seeds versus each other
  in a particular round. When there is no data, 1-(winning seed)/(winning seed +
  losing seed) is used to estimate the probability of the win.
- Improve install.php so that it recognizes versions and tries to run different 
  database scripts based on this.
- Improve the efficiency of calculate_paths_to_victory.php
- Numerous other UI and back end tweaks.
- Calculate eliminations more accurately.

- Thanks to Brian Battaglia (botagrox) and Robert Jailall (enryonaku)

--------------------
2 Requirements
--------------------
-PHP 4.1 or higher (http://www.php.net/)
-MySQL (or access to a server running this)
-A web server(Apache, IIS, etc)
-JavaScript-enabled browser (for bracket submission)

--------------------
3 Installation
--------------------

1) Extract the files from the archive.
   (in linux: tar -zxf mmm_vX.Y.Z.tar.gz)

2) Copy the tourney folder to a directory accessible from the web.
   (usually /somewhere/public_html/)

2a) It is STRONGLY suggested that you password protect the 'admin' directory 
    with an .htpasswd file.  There is a nice tool 
    (http://www.clockwatchers.com/htaccess_tool.html) that can handle this if 
    you don't know how.  Many people have this functionality built into their
    cPanel. Otherwise, anyone will be able to mess around with the brackets 
    and scoring, which could cause quite a bit of trouble.

3) Using phpMyAdmin, the command line, or any other method, create a database and user.  
   Rename /admin/database.php.tmpl to database.php
   Edit /admin/database.php to contain the proper information. 
   This is crucial in configuring the site.

4) Open your favorite web browser and point it at your installation directory.  
   If you have not yet configured the site, a message should be displayed 
   reminding you to set things up.  Click this link and fill out all the 
   necessary information.  Click "Finish" and if no errors appear, you
   are good to go!

Other Notes:
   - For a free pool, set the entry fee at 0.  Users will automatically be 
     marked as exempt from paying and the pot size will not be visible.
   - Cut size should be entered in dollars and cents (i.e. 2.50) or percent (i.e. 5).
   - If you do not have a mailserver, turn off notification emails.
    
--------------------
4 Usage
--------------------

Thankfully usage should be much easier than installation.  Open up your favorite
web browser and point it at the admin directory under the directory you installed 
March Madness Bracket Competition into.
(eg. http://www.yoursite.com/admin/)

At this point you should have the admin menu up.

1) Once the bracket has been released, click "Initialize the Bracket" from the 
   admin menu, or navigate to www.yoursite.com/admin/start.htm.  From here, you
   may enter the matchups.  Upon submitting this form, the competition 
   officially begins!  The submission form will become available and entries may
   be submitted.

2) You may now post/delete blog entries in a WYSIWYG editor.

3) You can modify the rules page as you wish, also through a WYSIWYG editor.  
   I recommend including at least a deadline and some contact information for yourself.

4) The master bracket may be updated by clicking "Edit Master Bracket" at the 
   admin menu or at www.yoursite.com/admin/bracket.php.  The entire bracket is
   overwritten every time you modify it. Upon submitting the form, it automatically
   grabs the winners and losers of each game and runs the scoring script.

5) Payment tracking is available.  Click the "Edit Paid List" to set each entrant's 
   status. If you run a free pool, all users will be set as exempt. Users can view
   the list at www.yoursite.com/paid.php, which is linked through the sidebar.

6) NOTES on Paths To Victory
   Paths to vistory should not be run before the final 16 games.  A great deal
   of information is calculated by this process, it is still possible that this
   may cause a timeout on your web server, which can cause partially computed
   results.  If this should happen, the paths can be calculated manually on
   your server using this command line in your install directory:
      php ./admin/calculate_paths_to_victory.php truncate
   The final 'truncate' keyword is only needed if you have partial results
   calculated, as they must be cleaned up.  Once 14 or fewer games remain, this
   function should be able to complete successfully from the browser unless you
   have a huge number of brackets, in which case the command line will still
   have to be used.

If something is majorly messed up, please post in the Sourceforge help forum.
We will try to respond ASAP.  Keep in mind we monitor more heavily in the month
preceeding the Tourney.

If there are any features you would like to see, please submit a request on the
Sourceforge project page.

Thanks for using March Madness Bracket Competition!
